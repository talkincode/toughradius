<p>This package contains classes for encoding and decoding Radius packets.</p>

<p>The base class RadiusPacket can read and write every Radius packet, the
subclasses AccessRequest and AccountingRequest provide convenience
methods to ease the access of special packet attributes.</p>

<p>The class AccessRequest manages the encryption of
passwords in the attributes User-Password (PAP) or CHAP-Password and
CHAP-Challenge (CHAP).</p>

<p>Each Radius packet has an associated dictionary of attribute
types that allows the convenient access to packet attributes
and sub-attributes.</p>
